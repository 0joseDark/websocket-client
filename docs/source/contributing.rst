Contributing
############

All contributions are welcome! To submit a suggestion, you can either create a
new issue (after searching for an existing issue that covers the same topic)
or submit a pull request with the edits that you would like to see in the
repository.

If you are contributing to the project's documentation, which is still in its
early stages, it is recommended that you install Sphinx and build the updated
documentation locally before submitting
your edits. The Sphinx dependencies can be installed by navigating to the
docs/source directory and running ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. To build
a new version of the documentation, navigate to the docs/ directory and run
``make clean html``. Any build warnings or errors will be displayed in your
terminal, and the new documentation will then be available in the
docs/build/html directory. You may also find the
`Sphinx documentation style guide
<https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html>`_
useful when editing reStructuredText (reST), which is quite different from
Markdown.
